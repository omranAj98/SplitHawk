# splithawk

A mobile application built from scratch to help users split bills and track group expenses, inspired by Splitwise. This is an ongoing personal project demonstrating full-stack app development.

- Sole Developer: Architected and built the entire application from concept to a functional prototype.

- State Management: Implemented a clean, scalable, and testable architecture using the BLoC pattern for all state management.

- UI/UX: Designed and built a responsive, cross-platform user interface using Flutter, focusing on a simple and intuitive user experience.

- Core Features: Engineered the core logic for user authentication, group creation, expense logging, and real-time balance calculations.

- Tech Stack: Flutter, BLoC / flutter_bloc, Dart. (Add others like Firebase, Hive, etc., if you used them)
